task2

Change the 'sum' function so that it was declared as an extension to List<Int>

task3

Mastermind is a board game for two players. The first player invents a code and the second player tries to guess this code. A code is made up 4 coloured pins and their position. There are 6 colours to choose from and the same colour can be repeated multiple times.

task4

Add and implement an extension function 'isEmptyOrNull()' on the type String?.
It should return true, if the string is null or empty.

task5

Declare the s variable to make the first line print null
and the second one throw an exception

task6

Functions 'all', 'none' and 'any' are interchangeable, you can use one or the other to implement the same functionality.
Implement the functions 'allNonZero' and 'containsZero' using all three predicates in turn. 'allNonZero' checks that all the elements in the list are non-zero; 'containsZero' checks that the list contains zero element.
Add the negation before the whole call (right before 'any', 'all' or 'none') when necessary, not only inside the predicate.

task7

Mastermind in a functional style
